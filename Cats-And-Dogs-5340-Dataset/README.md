# COVIDGR-Dataset
In close collaboration with a team of expert radiologists from the Hospital Universitario San Cecilio, the COVIDGR-1.0 dataset was created, consisting of anonymized X-ray images of patients. A total of 852 images were collected following a rigorous labeling protocol. These images are divided equally into 426 positive cases and 426 negative cases. Positive images are from patients who tested positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR, with a maximum of 24 hours between the X-ray image and the test result. All images were captured using the same type of equipment and format, with only posterior-anterior views considered. Further details about the image distribution are provided below.
